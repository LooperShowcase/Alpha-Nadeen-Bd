      <p>Samsung Electronics has played a key role in the group's corporate governance due to cross ownership.
         Samsung Electronics has assembly plants and sales networks in 74 countries and employs more than 270,000 people.
          It is majority-owned by foreign investors.
           As of 2019, Samsung Electronics is the world's second-largest technology company by revenue,
            and its market capitalization stood at US$520.65 billion,the 12th largest in the world.</p>

        In 2012, Kwon Oh-hyun was appointed the company's CEO. He announced in
        October 2017 that he would resign in March 2018, citing an
        "unprecedented crisis".[ The company had 3 CEOs (Ki Nam Kim, Hyun Suk
        Kim, and Dong-Jin Koh) from March 2018 until December 2021, when the
        business units were reorganized, and they were replaced by Kyung
        Kye-Hyun and Han Jong-hee. It has also had a separate regional CEO, HC
        Hong, who led the business in Southwest Asia from 2015 and then moved to
        Latin America in 2020

        Samsung Electric Industries was established as an industrial part of
        Samsung Group on 19 January 1969 in Suwon, South Korea. At the time,
        Samsung Group was known to the South Korean public as a trading company
        specialized in fertilizers and sweeteners. Despite the lack of
        technology and resources, falling shorter even than the domestic
        competitors, Samsung Group improved its footing in the manufacturing
        industry by cooperating with the Japanese companies, a decision that
        instigated a significant amount of anti-Japanese public outcry and huge
        backlashes from the competitors fearing the outright subordination of
        the industry by the Japanese. The strategy was able to take off only
        after the government and Samsung declared that the company would
        exclusively focus on exports. Toshio Iue, the founder of Sanyo, played a
        role as an advisor to Lee Byung-chul, Samsung's founder, who was a
        novice in the electronics business. December the same year, Samsung
        Electric established a joint venture named Samsung-Sanyo Electric with
        Sanyo and Sumitomo Corporation. This is the direct predecessor of
        today's Samsung Electronics.
