            Samsung Electric Industries was established as an industrial part of
            Samsung Group on 19 January 1969 in Suwon, South Korea. At the time,
            Samsung Group was known to the South Korean public as a trading company
            specialized in fertilizers and sweeteners.<br />
            The strategy was able to take off only after the government and Samsung
            declared that the company would exclusively focus on exports.
          </p>
          <p>The joint venture's early products were electronic and electrical appliances including televisions,
             calculators, refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines. 
             In 1970,
              Samsung established the joint venture Samsung-NEC with Japan's NEC Corporation and Sumitomo Corporation to manufacture home appliances and audiovisual devices.
               Samsung-NEC later became Samsung SDI, the group's display and battery business unit.
               In 1973, Samsung and Sanyo created Samsung-Sanyo Parts, the predecessor of Samsung Electro-Mechanics.
             By 1981, Samsung Electric had manufactured over 10 million black-and-white televisions.</p>
          <p>
            In 1974, Samsung Group expanded into the semiconductor business by
            acquiring Korea Semiconductor, which was on the verge of bankruptcy
            while building one of the first chip-making facilities in the country at
            the time. Soon after, Korea Telecommunications, an electronic switching
            system producer and a Samsung Group company, took over the semiconductor
            business and became Samsung Semiconductor & Communications.
